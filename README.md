# voting-system-
This is basic Voting System app, which is made to elect CR/CCM.
Basically, it considers two people who have got highest votes, and makes highest as CR, and second highest as CCM.

The data is stored in the localStorage of the browser, so please use a single system to cast votes.

Thank You.....

## Please Note
To avoid random access, I have added a passkey to access the voters of candidates. 
Passkey : osoc@nitt
